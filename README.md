This is the UX/UI portion of a full-stack paired project. We first created the RESTful Api and database before building this application. Palette picker was inspired by the well known [Coolors](https://coolors.co/393d3f-fdfdff-c6c5b9-62929e-546a7b) site. With detailed planning and consistant communication, majority of this project was completed remotely. This was a great opportunity pracitce our workflow as part of a team.
